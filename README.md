# Domino's House

##Criteria & Resources

Before making my plans, I researched a lot of literature about feral cat shelters. Based on that research, I wanted to incorporate the following elements:
* Elevated platform
* Two exits (provides an emergency exit in case of an intruder).
* Sloping roof (for rain runoff)
* Perch
* Openable roof

We are in San Francisco, California, where temperatures don't drop enough that insulation, door flaps or straw bedding would become necessary.

After completing the build, I came across an article called "[The Myth of the Emergency Exit](https://feralvilla-com.3dcartstores.com/The-Myth-of-the-Emergency-Exit_ep_43.html)" on Feral Villa that questions the need for two exits. I think that this is something to potentially further think about, especially in cold climates where two exits will increase the challenge of keeping the inside of the house warm.

Alley Cat Allies has a [great list](https://www.alleycat.org/resources/feral-cat-shelter-options-gallery/) of various ready-made houses, as well as DIY plans out there. They list the pros and cons for each.

In particular, Domino's house most resembles the FIVER plans. Check out [their website](http://www.fivercats.com) for a very detailed plan as well as videos on how to build their version.
